this note include my thought process and ideas while coding and a temporary place for saving used resources url, it doesn't represent the final game functionality or design

research how to have the moles come out of their holes frame by frame to make it more animated instead of just poping suddenly

just hitting mules is boring, add bombs, if the player hit the bomb he loses instantly,
add mute button if you gonna add music background to the game



keep in mind to only add points to score on active cells

how to store the moles that pop up in a different var?
for each mole hit score++ for each bomb score-- or call gameover()
add sound per pop up and hits
sound for timer duration and last 5sec
